AST-aware [`v8-to-istanbul`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-to-istanbul).

Unopinionated - _bring-your-own_ AST parser and source maps.

Passes all 195 tests<sup>[*](#istanbul-compatibility)</sup> of [`istanbul-lib-instrument`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/main/packages/istanbul-lib-instrument/test/specs). ‚úÖ

```ts
import { convert } from "ast-v8-to-istanbul";
import { parseAstAsync } from "vite";
import type { CoverageMap } from "istanbul-lib-coverage";

const coverageMap: CoverageMap = await convert({
  // Bring-your-own AST parser
  ast: parseAstAsync(<code>),

  // Code of the executed file (not the source file)
  code: "function sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b ...",

  // Execution wrapper offset
  wrapperLength: 0,

  // Script coverage of the executed file
  coverage: {
    scriptId: "123",
    url: "file:///absolute/path/to/dist/index.js",
    functions: [
      {
        functionName: "sum",
        ranges: [{ startOffset: 223, endOffset: 261, count: 0 }],
        isBlockCoverage: false,
      },
      // ... etc
    ],
  },

  // Source map of the executed file
  sourceMap: {
    version: 3,
    sources: ["../sources.ts"],
    sourcesContent: ["export function sum(a: number, b: number) {\n..."],
    mappings: ";AAAO,SAAS,...",
    names: [],
  },
});
```

## Ignoring code

### Ignoring source code

The typical ignore hints from `nyc` are supported: https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc?tab=readme-ov-file#parsing-hints-ignoring-lines.

In addition to `istanbul` keyword, you can use `v8`, `c8` and `node:coverage`:

- `/* istanbul ignore if */`
- `/* v8 ignore else */`
- `/* c8 ignore file */`
- `/* node:coverage ignore next */`

### Ignoring generated code

This API is mostly for developers integrating `ast-v8-to-istanbul` with other tooling.

If your code transform pipeline is adding generated code that's included in the source maps, it will be included in coverage too.
You can exclude these known patterns by defining `ignoreNode` for filtering such nodes.

```ts
function ignoreNode(node: Node, type: "branch" | "function" | "statement"): boolean | void;
```

```ts
import { convert } from "ast-v8-to-istanbul";

await convert({
  ignoreNode: (node, type) => {
    // Ignore all `await __vite_ssr_import__( ... )` calls that Vite SSR transform adds
    return (
      type === "statement" &&
      node.type === "AwaitExpression" &&
      node.argument.type === "CallExpression" &&
      node.argument.callee.type === "Identifier" &&
      node.argument.callee.name === "__vite_ssr_import__"
    );
  },
});
```

## Source maps

Source maps are optional and supported by various ways:

- Pass directly to `convert` as argument:
  ```ts
  import { convert } from "ast-v8-to-istanbul";

  await convert({
    sourceMap: {
      version: 3,
      sources: ["../sources.ts"],
      sourcesContent: ["export function sum(a: number, b: number) {\n..."],
      mappings: ";AAAO,SAAS,...",
      names: [],
    }
  });
  ```
- Include base64 encoded inline maps in `code`:
  ```ts
  await convert({
    code: `\
    function hello() {}
    //# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,eyJzb3VyY2VzIjpbIi9zb21lL...
    `
  });
  ```
- Include inline maps with filename in `code`:
  ```ts
  await convert({
    code: `\
    function hello() {}
    //# sourceMappingURL=some-file-on-file-system.js.map
    `
  });
  ```
- Don't use source maps at all, and pass original source code in `code`:
  ```ts
  await convert({
    code: `function hello() {}`,
    sourceMap: undefined,
  });
  ```

## Istanbul Compatibility

This project tests itself against test cases of `istanbul-lib-instrument` and verifies coverage maps are 100% identical. Some cases, like [deprecated `with()` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with) and edge cases of strict mode are skipped, as all tests are run in strict mode.

100% istanbul compatibility guarantees that coverage reports between V8 and Istanbul can be merged together.

## Limitations

The way how V8 reports runtime coverage has some limitations when compared to pre-instrumented coverage:

- Unable to detect uncovered `AssignmentPattern`'s if line is otherwise covered
  - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/57435

- Unable to detect uncovered parts when block execution stops due to function throwing:
  - ```js
    function first() {
      throws()

      // unreachable, but incorrectly covered
      return "first";
    }

    const throws = ()  => { throw new Error() }

    try { first(1) } catch {}
    ```
  - ```json
    [
      {
        "ranges": [{ "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 165, "count": 1 }],
        "isBlockCoverage": true
      },
      {
        "functionName": "first",
        "ranges": [{ "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 92, "count": 1 }],
        "isBlockCoverage": true
      },
      {
        "functionName": "throws",
        "ranges": [{ "startOffset": 109, "endOffset": 137, "count": 1 }],
        "isBlockCoverage": true
      }
    ]
    ```
